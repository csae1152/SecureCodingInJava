# SecureCodingInJava

1. Thread-Safety issues
  - Background threads during class initialization
  - Object construction (Reference escape)
  - Don't override thread-safe methods with methods that aren't thread-safe.
  - Partially initialized objects.

2. Numeric Types and Operations
   - Convert integers to floating point
   - Be aware of numeric promotoin behaviour
   - Do not use denormalized numbers
   - Use the stricftp
  
3. Locking
   - Do not synchronize on the class object returned by getClass()
   - Ensure actively held locks are released on exceptional conditions
   - Use a correct form of the double-checked locking idiom
   - Avoid client-side locking when using classes that do not commit to their locking strategy.
  
4. Visibility and Atomicity (VNA)
  - Ensure visibility when accessing shared primitive variables.
  - Ensure that calls to chained methods are atomic.
  - Ensure visibility of shared references to immutable objects.
